/*
    // Access elements of Matrix Data Structure
        Like one-dimensional arrays, matrices can be accessed randomly by using their indices to access the
        individual elements. A cell has two indices, one for its row number, and the other for its column
        number. We can use arr[i][j] to access the element which is at the ith row and jth column of the
        matrix.
